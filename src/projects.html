                <p>
                    The last surviving of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of the most recognizable landmarks. But who built them and Why!??
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids as tombs to bury their mighty noble Pharaohs accompanied with all burial material goods that ranged from everyday objects like personal belongings to the most expensive items like Jewelry. They had a strong belief in the afterlife and that the dead kings would use these items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guarding these mortuary buildings is the “Sphinx”, one of the ancient world’s iconic monuments. Having the face of a pharaoh and the body of a lion it is considered the largest monolith statue in the world.

                <p>
                    The lake has an interesting history and there are some fascinating theories about how it came to be known as Lake Qarun and it remains a mystery how it was formed.</p>
                <p>
                    Near the lake, an ancient building called Qasr Qarun, or Qarun’s Mansion, is believed to be the house of an opulent exultant individual named “Qarun” as described and mentioned in both the Bible and the Quran who was a contemporary of Prophet Moses. The story tells that all his mansions and possessions flooded and swallowed up in the earth as a punishment from God for his sins.
                    <br>There are many myths and lots of stories but one thing is clear: it is beautiful

                <p>The Karnak Temple located on the banks of the River Nile in a small village at Al-Karnak, north of Luxor City in Upper Egypt is a fascinating colossal open-air museum and the largest ancient religious site ever built.</p>
                <p>Consisting of three main temples with colorful wall art of tombs and great stone columns in the temples, is what make it the second most important historical place of Egypt just after the Giza Pyramids near Cairo.</p>
                <p> Hidden between rocky escarpments and behind the cliffs lies the famous Valley of the Kings. Within the valley are 63 tombs that are a roll-call of famous names of Egyptian history including the famous boy-king Tutankhamun. The royal tombs are decorated with wonderfully vivid wall paintings and scenes from Egyptian mythology that give clues to the beliefs and funerary rituals back then.

                <p>Egyptian culture has thousands of years of recorded history. It passed by many diverse civilizations from Ancient Egypt to the Egypt we know now. It was able to maintain a stable and complex culture throughout the years which later on influenced other cultures like the European culture, Middle East Culture, and the African culture. Their mother tongue is Arabic and most Egyptians are quiet intelligent when it comes to knowing other languages so you’d find a little bit of English here and a few French over there. Yeah, Egyptians are flexible like that!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="culture-people">
                <p>Egyptian people are one of a kind. They are well known for their hospitality and kindness. You’d never feel like a stranger when you’re among Egyptians. Egyptians also have a huge respect for their families and consider them as one of the most valuable aspects in their lives. When you meet an Egyptian, always greet them with “Al-Salam Aleikum” and a hand shake as a sign of respect. When an Egyptian invites you over for Dinner, bring them a symbolic gift such as a box of chocolate. It shows that you’re grateful for the invitation. When it comes to communication, Egyptians can be a little, just a little, “Loud” and they use a lot of hand gestures. It’s an indication that they’re excited or trying to demonstrate a certain point.</p>

                    Egypt, with its very diverse culture and people, has many celebrations across the year. This is due to the diverse religions Egypt hosts (Islam and Christianity) and national celebrations as well. From the very famous and well-celebrated festivities in Egypt are the following:
                </p>
                <h3>Eid Al Fetr (Al Fetr Feast)</h3>
                <p>
                    It comes after the holy month of Ramadan. It is a symbol of breaking Ramadan’s fast and lasts for three days. Egyptian women usually bake a special kind of cookies called “Kahk” in this feast. People celebrate it by buying new clothes, praying together in the early morning of the first day of feast, then visit their families where they spend the day having breakfast and lunch together.
                </p>
                <h2>Eid Al Adha (Al-Adha Feast)</h2>
                <p>
                    During the Hajj time (when the Muslim from all over the world visit the holy city of Mecca-Saudi Arabia to do The Hajj ceremony), Egyptians celebrate this time with Al-Adha Feast for four days. This feast is an Islamic event and usually celebrated by scarifying a sheep or cow for the sake of the less fortunate of the society. Egyptians share their meet with the less fortunate then gather with their families to celebrate this holy occasion
                </p>
                <h3>Christmas</h3>
                <p>
                    The fun part of celebrating Christmas in Egypt is that you get to celebrate it twice. The traditional Christmas in Egypt is on the 7th of January but Egyptians celebrate Christmas on the 25th of December as well. As a sign of Christmas love, you’d find Christmas decorations all over Egyptian streets and malls from Mid-December till Mid-January. A lot of love is shown to this jolly season.
                </p>
                <h3>Easter (Sham El Neseem)</h3>
                <p>
                    Easter or “Sham El Neseem” is one of the oldest celebrations in Egypt. Egyptians have been celebrating “Sham El Neseem” since Ancient Egypt. “Sham El Neseem” literally means air breathing, but it stands for Easter in Egypt. Egyptians usually celebrate Easter egg coloring with their families and friends then having the traditional Easter meal which is boiled colored eggs and pickled fish. It might not sound as the most delicious dish you can have in Egypt, but it’s very yummy!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="culture-arts">
                <p>
                    Art plays a huge role in the Egyptian culture. Egypt is actually one of the very first civilizations to produce any kind of Art. Music and Dancing are the main forms of art Egyptians are talented in. Oriental Music is always playing in weddings, streets, parties, etc. And Dancing is practically part of every Egyptian boy and girl’s personality, whether it’s normal dancing, Belly dancing, or Tanoura dancing.
